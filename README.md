# Malaysian-OrangAsli-Bloodgroups
<h1> Genotype data of the blood group related variants in the Malaysian Orang Asli population </h1>
This repository aims to provide an open source site for accessing the blood group related variant genotypes of the Malaysian Orang Asli population

<h2> Details of the study </h2>
Orang Asli population is an aboriginal minority group inhabiting the Peninsular Malaysia and East of Malaysia. They represent ~0.7% of the Malaysian population and comprise three major tribal groups namely,
- Semang/Negrito <br/>
- Senoi/Sakai <br/>
- Proto-/Aboriginal Malays  <br/>
This study aims to curate and annotate a comprehensive collection of blood alleles prevailing in the aboriginal Orang Asli population along with systematic prediction of complete blood group phenotypes from whole genome data.  We also intend to filter population specific novel and rare variants with potential impacts in blood group profiles
